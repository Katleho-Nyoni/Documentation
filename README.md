## üìñEssays
- ### [Will I Eventually be Employed: A Mathematica Approach](https://rpubs.com/LordEagle/Unemployment)
  " Unemployment has caused devastation not only to new graduates, but also to experienced individuals on a global scale. This has led to many individuals to think that there are no jobs, their field is saturated or worse ‚Äî that they‚Äôre just not enough. While some get employed before they graduate, others wait years for their first employment after graduation. As stressed as you are, you‚Äôre probably wondering whether you‚Äôll eventually be employed, and if so, when will this be. Venture with me as I use mathematics to answer the former. The latter we‚Äôll leave to God. "

## üìäReports
- ### [Forecasting the sales of Food and Beverages of South Africa](https://rpubs.com/LordEagle/TSA1)
  " The Box and Jenkins methodology to Time Series Analysis(TSA) has shed light on how to deal with processes that do not follow classical methods. I use the Box and Jenkins methodology to fit and find a candidate model for the sales of the Food and Beverages of South Africa(SA). This analysis features fitting various seasonal ARIMA models to the sales of the Food & Beverages of South Africa as well as testing the necessary assumptions. The ARIMA(2,1,3)(1,1,0) is chosen to be the best model and the analysis proceeds to forecast future values and evaluates the performance of the model using the MAPE(evaluated to be 1.98%) metric.

### [DG Consulting](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Private)
**`Full-Stack`**

***Problem Statement:*** According to different sources, between 50-80% of data is considered to be *Dark Data*, depending on different industies and businesses. Dark data refers to data that is not used to discover underlying dynamics or for business insight. The reasons differ in nature, but at the core of them all is merely because the data would be too messy or complex to deal with or understand. 

***Solution:*** To solve this crises in the age of *Big Data*, I'm creating DG(Data Group) Consuluting. A mock-up solution that will automatically generate reports for what I call **Over-Seeing Data Analyasts** so that they can analyse the statistics and graphical visualisations of the dataset, to decise if further analysis should be done on the dataset to reveal hiding patterns or complex dynamics that would be matching the evolving landscape of new mathematical & statistical techniques that are developed both in academia and industry. With time, I believe there will be a need for **Over-Seeing Data Analyst**, these would be Data Analysts that primarily work on creating automation systems, debugging them and analysing results provided by the automation systems.
