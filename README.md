# Section A
## üìñEssays
- ### [Will I Eventually be Employed: A Mathematica Approach](https://rpubs.com/LordEagle/Unemployment)
  " Unemployment has caused devastation not only to new graduates, but also to experienced individuals on a global scale. This has led to many individuals to think that there are no jobs, their field is saturated or worse ‚Äî that they‚Äôre just not enough. While some get employed before they graduate, others wait years for their first employment after graduation. As stressed as you are, you‚Äôre probably wondering whether you‚Äôll eventually be employed, and if so, when will this be. Venture with me as I use mathematics to answer the former. The latter we‚Äôll leave to God. "

## üìäReports
- ### [Bone Marrow Density(BMD) Analysis](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Projects)
  "This project uses the most recent and effective method of dealing with missing data and recovering(predicting) 25% of the data that was missing, greatly improving the quality of the data and reliability of future tests to be ran on that dataset. "

- ### [Employee's Satisfaction](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Projects)
  " The analyses investigates how gender and education affects the happiness of an employee at a certain company, using Data Analysis techniques. "
  
- ### [Forecasting the sales of Food and Beverages of South Africa](https://rpubs.com/LordEagle/TSA1)
  " The Box and Jenkins methodology to Time Series Analysis(TSA) has shed light on how to deal with processes that do not follow classical methods. I use the Box and Jenkins methodology to fit and find a candidate model for the sales of the Food and Beverages of South Africa(SA). This analysis features fitting various seasonal ARIMA models to the sales of the Food & Beverages of South Africa as well as testing the necessary assumptions. The ARIMA(2,1,3)(1,1,0) is chosen to be the best model and the analysis proceeds to forecast future values and evaluates the performance of the model using the MAPE(evaluated to be 1.98%) metric.

## üîêCompleted
- ### [e-Commerce](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/NextJS)

Building an e-commerce website.
- ### [My Website](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/website)
 **`In Progress`** : **To Be Edited/Changed**
 
 This is my personal website that shows my projects and some other information.
 
 *I have completed this website. However, I'm working on changing it entirely to optimize the feel, presentation and performance.*
 
- ### [Katieum's App](https://katieum.co.za)
 **`Scheduled`** : **To Be Edited/Changed**
 
 This website was the initialization stage of [Katieum](#Katieum) so I can later create a fully-functional web-app with videos, books & other resources.
 
 *I have completed this website. However, I've scheduled to improve the presentation and performance pf this web-app. Also add more features and complete it.*

## ‚è≥In-Progress
- ### [Buying & Selling site](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Private)
 **`Full-Stack`**

 Building a Buy & Sell app where users can list items they're selling(like Facebook's marketplace).

- ### [DG Consulting](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Private)
**`Full-Stack`**

Building an AI Agent that can do Explanatory Data Analysis.
<!--
***Problem Statement:*** According to different sources, between 50-80% of data is considered to be *Dark Data*, depending on different industies and businesses. Dark data refers to data that is not used to discover underlying dynamics or for business insight. The reasons differ in nature, but at the core of them all is merely because the data would be too messy or complex to deal with or understand. 

***Solution:*** To solve this crises in the age of *Big Data*, I'm creating DG(Data Group) Consuluting. A mock-up solution that will automatically generate reports for what I call **Over-Seeing Data Analyasts** so that they can analyse the statistics and graphical visualisations of the dataset, to decise if further analysis should be done on the dataset to reveal hiding patterns or complex dynamics that would be matching the evolving landscape of new mathematical & statistical techniques that are developed both in academia and industry. With time, I believe there will be a need for **Over-Seeing Data Analyst**, these would be Data Analysts that primarily work on creating automation systems, debugging them and analysing results provided by the automation systems.

- ### [PregCa](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/PregCa)
**`Frontend`**

Preg-Ca is a Pregnancy Calculator that let's you estimate if you & your partner have possibly conseived by using simple Mathematics.

- ### [Katieum](https://github.com/E4Katieum)
**`Educational`**

Plateform that presents a series of lectures in Mathematics for grade 10 to 12 learners using interactive animation/visualization.

## üí°Scheduled
- ### [e-Tracking](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Private)
**`Full-Stack`** <br>
Track devices by merging software development and ethical hacking principles.

- ### [Ticket Logging system](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Private)
**`Full-Stack`** <br>
Most big corporate companies needs a ticket logging system where employees can log ticket & report computer related issue. These tickets would then be attended by people from the IT department as it's often *illigal* to modify company devices as an administrator, or elevating your privilege.
