### [DG Consulting](https://github.com/Katleho-Nyoni/Private)
**`Full-Stack`**

***Problem Statement:*** According to different sources, between 50-80% of data is considered to be *Dark Data*, depending on different industies and businesses. Dark data refers to data that is not used to discover underlying dynamics or for business insight. The reasons differ in nature, but at the core of them all is merely because the data would be too messy or complex to deal with or understand. 

***Solution:*** To solve this crises in the age of *Big Data*, I'm creating DG(Data Group) Consuluting. A mock-up solution that will automatically generate reports for what I call **Over-Seeing Data Analyasts** so that they can analyse the statistics and graphical visualisations of the dataset, to decise if further analysis should be done on the dataset to reveal hiding patterns or complex dynamics that would be matching the evolving landscape of new mathematical & statistical techniques that are developed both in academia and industry. With time, I believe there will be a need for **Over-Seeing Data Analyst**, these would be Data Analysts that primarily work on creating automation systems, debugging them and analysing results provided by the automation systems.
